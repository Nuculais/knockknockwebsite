### *Our purpose*
#### _Why we started on our journey_
The population of the world are aging, and with that comes the increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s and Dementhia-related disorders. It is expected that by the year 2030, around 180-190.000 Swedish elders and 75 million elders worldwide will have Dementhia*, with around 60-70% of these having Alzheimer’s**.
A common symptom is loss of memory, they can forget the faces and sometimes even the existence of loved ones, friends family or care personnel. 
For many, this is not only a great source of shame, but also puts them at risk; for instance, if a stranger with malicious intent knocks on their door attempting to get in.
Our elders deserve better than that.

### *Our product*
#### _What do we offer?_
The Knock-knock system uses [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Face Recognition](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) to deliver a cutting-edge experience of modern artificial intelligence.
It lets a trusted administrator (who can be, for instance, a family member or care company  personnel) add photos of Trusted Contacts and descriptions of who they are and what the relationship to the elderly user is. The AI then learns to recognize these faces.
When a person knocks on the door of a customer using Knock-knock, a sign by the door will instruct them to go to a website and input a unique code (of which there is one for every Knock-knock user). There, they will take a photo of themselves which the system will analyze. If the face is found in the list of Trusted Contacts, a tablet on the inside of the house (this can also be used with a smartphone, or a speech interface such as a Google Home or Amazon Alexa) alerts the user on the other side of the door to who is visiting. They can then decide if they want to let them in or not. 
They will also be alerted that an unauthorized person wants to come in, if the visitor is not found in Trusted Contacts. 
We believe that this product has the potential to
